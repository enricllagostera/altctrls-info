Are you interested in [games that let us play differently](http://shakethatbutton.com/about-alternative-controllers/)? Have you found some intriguing project on [Shake That Button](http://shakethatbutton.com/) and would like to find some extra information to help you start to make your own thing? This community-curated list of resources is here to support you: it is focused on tools, materials, and things that you can use to make alternative controllers.

If you'd like to participate in making this list, please check the [contributing section](#contributing). Suggestions, revisions, and ideas are always welcome!

### How to Use

## Resources

### Crafting

- [Adaptive Design Learning Library](https://www.adaptivedesign.org/learning-library) - Thorough, didactic, and detailed guide for building user-specific adaptations out of cardboard. It is a great resource for building sturdy and appoachable objects. Made by Adaptive Design Association Inc. Price: Free. 
- [PVC construction](https://www.instructables.com/id/PVC-101/) - Very practical guide about constructing things with PVC pipes: a lightweight and affordable material. Made by trevormates.
- [Recipes for conductive and non-conductive dough](https://squishycircuits.com/pages/dough-recipes) - You can use these to create soft surfaces and malleable circuits for your games. Made by Squishy Circuits. Price: Free.
- [Worbla](http://www.cosplaysupplies.com/store.php?p=WOBA1) - This is a thermoplastic used often for making costumes and cosplay props. It can be hand-molded when heated and is easy to prime and finish. Price: 29 USD for a small sheet.

### Electronics

- [Arduino Uno](https://store.arduino.cc/usa/arduino-uno-rev3) - a versatile board that has a good balance between number of connections, simplicity, and tons of libraries, examples, and compatible platforms. Made by Arduino. Price: 22 USD. License: open-source hardware.
- Conductive thread resources.
- [Makey Makey](https://makeymakey.com/) - a board that turns low-current connections into keypresses and mouse events, without changing any software. Great for turning bananas into keyboards! Made by JoyLabz. Price: 50 USD. License: Proprietary.
- [Micro:bit](https://microbit.org/) - a small board with built-in accelerometers, compass and radio. It features a block-based visual programming system and can connect via USB and Bluetooth. Made by BBC. Price: 27 CAD.
- Teensy.

### Game Engine Plugins and Tools

If you are making a game using some specific game engines, you might be able to use some of the resources below to connect your alternative controller to the software.

- Serial Port in Godot game engine.
- Ardity : A serial port plugin for Unity.
- Alan Zucconi's Arduino and Unity articles.
- OscJack : A small library for receiving and sending OSC messages in Unity.
- MidiJack : A small library for receiving and sending MIDI messages in Unity.

### Software

- [JoyToKey](https://joytokey.net/en/) - a desktop software that converts inputs from gamepads and joysticks to keyboard and mouse. Price: free trial and 7 USD for continued use. License: shareware.

### Libraries

- [Johnny-Five](http://johnny-five.io/) - a JavaScript library for accessing boards and sensors. Made by Bocoup and contributors. Price: free. License: MIT.

### Open Projects and Making Ofs

Some times it can be helpful to see the source code, diagrams, documents, and process of different projects. This topic is a list of _making of_ articles, as well as free and open-source projects.

- [Red Dirt](https://github.com/enricllagostera/RedDirt) - A narrative game using smartphone magnetic sensors, made in Unity, using [Sensing Gestures](https://github.com/enricllagostera/SensingGestures). Created by Enric Llagostera. Price: Free. License: LGPLv3.

## Contributing

Our goal is to slowly grow this list so it can help more folks. You are welcome to contribute with tools and resources that have helped you to create different ways to play / interact with a game.

[You can use this link to propose new resources or help us fix errors in the list.](https://github.com/enricllagostera/awesome-altctrls/issues/new/choose) If you contribute, we will add your name (or nickname) to the contributors list by default, but you can opt-out too. Just mention that in your contribution issue.

We aim to be informative and support people in diverse situations. To help with that, we ask contributors to provide each link with a short description and, if possible, information about price and / or license. When possible, please credit the creators of the resource on your link description. If you want to add the link to a specific topic or even propose a new topic altogether, that is great too.
