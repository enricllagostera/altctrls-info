Are you interested in [games that let us play differently](http://shakethatbutton.com/about-alternative-controllers/)? Have you found some intriguing project on [Shake That Button](http://shakethatbutton.com/) and would like to find some extra information to help you start to make your own thing? This community-curated list of resources is here to support you: it is focused on tools, materials, and things that you can use to make alternative controllers.

If you'd like to participate in making this list, please check the [contributing section](#contributing). Suggestions, revisions, and ideas are always welcome!

### How to Use
