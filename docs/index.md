## Contributing

Our goal is to slowly grow this list so it can help more folks. You are welcome to contribute with tools and resources that have helped you to create different ways to play / interact with a game.

We aim to make available information to support people looking for tools and resources that fit their diverse situation. This means providing each link with a short description and, if possible, information about price and/or license. If you want to add the link to a specific topic or even propose a new topic altogether, that is great too.

Please, use the following format when contributing a tool or resource: `+ [Tool](link) — description. Price: <value>. License: <some license>.`
