Our goal is to slowly grow this list so it can help more folks. You are welcome to contribute with tools and resources! We aim to be informative and support people in diverse situations, and we prioritize affordable and approachable resources.

To help with that, we ask contributors to provide each resource with a short description, information about price and / or license and credits (with a link) to the resource creators. If you want to add a resource to a specific topic or even propose a new topic altogether, that is great too. If you contribute, we will add your name (or nickname) and optionally a link to the contributors list by default, but you can opt-out too. Just mention that in your contribution.
